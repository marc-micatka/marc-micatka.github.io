Hello! My name is Marc Micatka. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at the Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington. I recently finished my Master's in Computer Science at Georgia Tech specializing in Robot Perception and Automation and am so glad to be done. Although I have to work around the busy schedule of a global pandemic, I also try and find time to travel around the country and world with my lovely wife. I enjoy finding efficient and practical solutions to problems in a class setting, a work setting, or on my own.

I love traveling and being outside, whether it's in the mountains or in a city. Currently living in Seattle exploring the Cascades with gusto.

Publications
------------
[**Clustered Grasp Volumes for Improved Grasp Selection**](https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS55160.2024.10753754)
: *Author(s):* Marc Micatka, Aaron Marburg
: *Conference/Journal:* OCEANS 2024 - Halifax
: *Code:* [Github Repo](https://gitlab.com/apl-ocean-engineering/raven/manipulation)
: *Abstract:*
We propose a grasp selection algorithm that clusters grasps by pose and cost, creating discrete graspable volumes.
Grasps are chosen to maximize target visibility and arm manipulability, enabling flexible autonomous or human-supervised control.
The method is evaluated in simulation and with a Reach Robotics Bravo 7 arm, addressing challenges in unstructured and adversarial environments.

[**PUGS: Perceptual Uncertainty for Grasp Selection in Underwater Environments**](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2502.09824)
: *Author(s):* Onur Bagoren, Marc Micatka, Katherine A. Skinner, Aaron Marburg
: *Conference/Journal:* International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2024 (pre-print)
: *Code:* [Website](https://onurbagoren.github.io/PUGS/)
: *Abstract:*
We propose a framework that quantifies perceptual uncertainty in 3D reconstruction and incorporates it into grasp selection for autonomous underwater manipulation.
By propagating uncertainty from multi-view reconstruction, our method improves robustness against partial and noisy measurements.
The approach is validated with both simulated and real-world data.

[**An Open-Source Pipeline for Automated Subsea Object Grasping**](https://doi.org/10.1109/OCEANS55160.2024.10753754)
: *Author(s):* Aaron Marburg, Laura Lindzey, Marc Micatka, Tim Player, Anand Sekar
: *Conference/Journal:* OCEANS 2024 - Halifax
: *Code:* [Github Repo](https://gitlab.com/apl-ocean-engineering/raven/manipulation)
: *Abstract:*
Subsea manipulation with ROVs is challenging due to limited perception, complex dynamics, and harsh environments.
To address the high costs of development and testing, we present an open-source ROS1-based software stack for autonomous manipulation of loosely modeled subsea objects.
Tested in simulation and on a low-cost platform, it serves as a baseline for advancing subsea autonomy.
