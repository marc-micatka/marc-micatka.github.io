Hello! My name is Marc Micatka - I am an aspiring computer scientist/roboticists currently working on my Masters in CS at Georgia Tech specializing in Robot Perception and Automation while also traveling around the country and world with my lovely wife. I enjoy finding efficient and practical solutions to problems whether it's in a class setting, a work setting, or on my own.



At work, I enjoy tackling automation projects to reduce labor. I have written Excel/VBA macros to collate, analyze, and display data from disparate sources in dashboards. I have also written inspection software using Cognex VisionPro, Python/OpenCV, and Visual Studios to aid operators with inspection procedures.

As an undergrad studying mechanical engineer, I independently developed projects ranging from an Arduino controlled skittle sorting robot to a labor reduction program written in Matlab and C++ that automated a significant portion of an assembly process for Bose Corporation. I have been a valuable team member in many projects, including designing and developing a device to automatically calibrate a nuclear pressure transmitter.Along the way, I gained familiarity with C++, MATLAB, Creo, ANSYS, and SolidWorks. 

In my masters program, I have extensive experience with Java for Android app development and Python for computer vision, robotics, and data science applications. See my project pages for more information about my computer science experience through Georgia Tech.

I love traveling and being outside and exercising, whether it's in the mountains or on the water. My wife is travel nurse and we are routinely packing up and moving around the country. Currently living in South Lake Tahoe, you can most likely find me in the backpacking or climbing when I'm not coding.

Education
---------
2019-2021 (expected)
:   **Masters, Computer Science**; Georgia Tech (online)

    *Specialization: Robotic Perceptions and Automation*

2011-2014
:   **BME, Mechanical Engineering**; University of Minnesota - Twin Cities (Minneapolis, MN)

Experience
----------

**Your Most Recent Work Experience:**

Short text containing the type of work done, results obtained,
lessons learned and other remarks. Can also include lists and
links:

* First item

* Item with [link](http://www.example.com). Links will work both in
  the html and pdf versions.

**That Other Job You Had**

Also with a short description.

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
