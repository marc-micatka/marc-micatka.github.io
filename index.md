Hello! My name is Marc Micatka. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at the Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington. I completed my Master's in Computer Science at Georgia Tech specializing in Robot Perception and Automation and my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Minnesota. Always seeking opportunities to travel and explore the state, country and world with my lovely wife. I enjoy finding efficient and practical solutions to problems in a class setting, a work setting, or on my own.

I love traveling and being outside, whether it's in the mountains or in a city. Currently living in Seattle exploring the Cascades with gusto.
