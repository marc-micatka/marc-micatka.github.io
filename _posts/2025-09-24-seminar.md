## Overview

In the summer of 2025, I was invited to give a talk at work, as part of our seminar series. I would be focusing on underwater manipulation. This dovetailed nicely with needing to prepare a similar talk for the Oceans 2025 conference in October so I said yes. I was happy to have been asked to present, but I was also pretty nervous. 

The seminar timeslots are about 45 minutes of technical content, followed by a Q&A. I need to pull together graphics, videos, results...a summary of what I had spent about two years working on. It became quite daunting and stressful but I was ultimately quite happy with how it turned out. The full presentation is embedded below.
