## Overview

Marc’s golden birthday! 

This year I, Marc, wanted to do a group backpacking trip, which, because of the way it is, meant two more people! Ross and Jake signed up to hike the White Pass - Pilot Ridge trail over Labor Day weekend.

## Day 1 - Seattle - White Pass
Right! Friday morning we leave Seattle. The drive in is surprisingly short until the road fades from gravelly to pockmarked to cratered. Luckily we’re in Ross’ truck and Ross is driving. We bump our way to a packed trailhead and get on the trail.

It’s hot and muggy and our packs are heavy and the water sources are quite dry. We arrive at White Pass, and wander through the campground, eventually finding a spot tucked into the treeline, shade all day within the pines and killer views down the valley.


I love this scene of us in the trees, it looks like a movie! 

And it felt like one too. When you can feel the trip going well, the views are killer, the weather is amazing.


## Day 1.5 - White Pass to Cowboy Camp

Ross and I were attempting Glacier Peak the next morning so we left camp shortly after dinner that first evening to get a start down the trail. We traveled light, leaving tents behind as the night promised to be clear and cool. 

The summer sun in Washington lasts and lasts, the long shadows and golden light paint the ridges as we hike out of White Pass and around a horseshoe basin. 

Evening overtakes us and we put on our headlamps, deciding to walk until we feel ready to sleep. After a few miles, we are in the high alpine. The trees and grass have disappeared, turning into gravelly lake beds and low boulder fields. We drop our packs, lay our pads on a patch of sand, and fall asleep for a few hours with the dusty stripe of the Milky Way overhead.


## Day 2 - Glacier Peak

We start moving in the pre-dawn, estimating that to get up and back down the peak and then back to camp at the time we agreed upon will require a long day.

It was difficult to move quickly in the dark, making our way across the basin strewn with ribbons of melt water. White Chuck Glacier is looming off to our right, we can’t really see it but we can feel its presence in the darkness, an imposing wall of white, forcing us north towards Glacier Gap.

We climb through the gap and get to the snow, putting on crampons at 7am. Early morning light on a glacier is magical - the low angle light reveals the infinite textures of the ice sheet, long shadows. The way the crevasses glow, with ocean blue ice fading to pure black as you look deeper.

After working our way around a crevasse field, we gain the final ridge to the summit and drop our packs. We are approaching our turnaround time and I can tell we’re both flagging under the harsh sun and the high altitude. For once, the steep trail is shorter than it looks, and we pull ourselves onto the summit at 9:15am. The day is clear and we are on one of the highest peaks in the heart of Washington’s expansive wilderness. The views are endless and I am so proud of us for getting here. 

The sun is harsh and we can tell the snow is going to be very soft so we hustle back down the ridge. We meet two guides on their way up who let us know they put in a boot track through the glacier field. This is welcome news as we get to avoid backtracking down some steep soft snow. We pick our way across the glacier, hopping over crevasses.

I can tell we’re moving too slowly to meet our return time but there’s nothing really to do about it now except try to maintain a steady pace. We enter the basin crossed with streams but the trickles we were able to hop over in the morning are raging in the full heat of the day. We take our boots off and wade across.

At 1pm, we’re back on a more established trail again and we’ve been moving continuously for 9 hours. We’re sweaty and beat. Our feet are wet. We try our best to hustle the final miles back to White Pass. I know Mary will be worried by now as we’re more than an hour overdue. Luckily we meet Mary and Jake on the trail and reassure them that we’re fine, just tired. All is well. We are safe and all back together.

## Day 3 - White Pass - Upper Blue Lake

The next day, we are aiming for Upper Blue Lake. The trail is deceptively tough and we’re constantly gaining and dropping elevation in the direct sun. We finally top the ridge above the lake and look down. From above, we can see why it is such a popular destination. It’s azure blue and looks tantalizingly crisp and cool and inviting after such a hot and long day. We start heading down the trail when we see a group in clear distress. 

A woman is sitting on the trail, clutching her leg, with her friend standing nearby, looking apprehensive. We ask if they're okay and they say, no, they need help, the woman on the ground had rolled her ankle on a loose rock. Mary and I stabilize the ankle with some straps and a foam pad. The plan is for her to crab-walk down the steepest section of the trail while we hustle ahead of them to drop packs at a campsite. 

Three of us head back up the trail and help carry the injured person down the remaining way to the lake. Mary stays near the group, her calm and confident presence is a rare gift and invaluable in an emergency. There was a physical therapist at the camp that helped assess and wrap (professionally!) the ankle. The PT thought the ankle was broken and the group called for help with their emergency SOS device.

When the woman was safely in her camp, resting with her ankle taped, Mary came back to our camp and we were finally able to jump in that lake! Long delayed gratification! 

While we were swimming we heard the whump-whump of a helicopter. The pilot flew in low over the lake, buzzing the campground, before circling over the group in distress. An EMT was lowered and they clipped the injured party onto the line before they both got winched back up into the helicopter. There were maybe twenty people at the lake, all of us gawking but trying to stay out of the way of these heroes, these legends! All of us in camp were in awe of the rapid, competent response. 

This was the first time in many years of backpacking I've experienced anything like this and it was very intense! It was really nice to see the help other people offered, and a tad disheartening to reflect on how many people had walked past the group in distress. 

## Day 4 - Home

The next morning we left the lake, trudging downhill to the truck. A long hike, but blessedly uneventful.
