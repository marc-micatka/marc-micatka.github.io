### Planning
Our travel nursing adventure continues. From Bemidji, Minnesota we accepted a position in Bellevue, Washington outside of Seattle. We loaded up the car and drove to Seattle in April. 



### Departure - Day 1

### Green River Lakes - Day 2
We left left GRL early and hiked through the meadow to reach Cube Rock Pass. Along the way we got spectacular views of Squaretop Mountain (aptly named) and had a grizzly scare. Hiking through thick forest, we saw two cubs scamper up trees. Understandably, we immediately freaked out, huddled together and sang at the top of lungs while trying to get to higher ground. Luckily we never saw mama bear.

Our campsite for Day 2 was near Peak Lake, over 10,000ft. Luckily, it was much warmer and we were treated to clear blue skies and a gorgeous sunset on the rocks.
